# You Do

Use the knowledge from the standard algorithms in the notes to finish the `factorial` method.

The goal of the `factorial` method is that given a positive integer value, it multiplies all numbers less than it and itself and returns the value. i.e. `factorial(5)` would return `120` since `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1` is `120`, `factorial(7)` would return `5040` since `7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1` is `5040`, and `factorial(9)` would return `362880`.

Make sure you are returning a final answer!

Note that there are pre-loaded tests in the main method. When done correctly, the file should run and print the expected answers.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
