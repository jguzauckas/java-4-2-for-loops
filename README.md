# AP Computer Science A - Unit 4 Section 2

# `for` Loops

This section introduces another way to use iteration in our code; that is, the ability to repeat sections of code once, twice, or many times depending on certain situations. This gives us a lot of tools to be able to simplify certain tasks, or even make other tasks possible at all.

Due to the nature of Java, certain elements of a Java program are going to be taken for granted and ultimately ignored as we work with the basics, but are required for the program to run successfully. I encourage you to read them and start to internalize them as they'll become a key aspect of the work we do as the year goes on.

This section covers the following material:

- `for` Loops
- `for` and `while` Loop Equivalence
- Off-By-One Errors

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
