# Understanding Check

Let's work with `String` objects and see how they interact with loops!

Complete the `printLetters` method, whose goal is to print out each individual letter in a provided `String`. For example, `printLetters("Hi")` would print out `H` and `i`, and `printLetters("Hello")` would print out `H`, `e`, `l`, `l`, and `o`.

Some hints for your work:
- Using the length of the `String` in your `boolean` condition.
- Use your loop control variable with the `substring` method to print out a letter.

Make sure you are printing, not returning!

Complete the `countSpaces` method, whose goal is count the number of times a space character ` ` occurs in a provided `String`. For example, `countSpaces("Hello, World!")` would return `1`, and `countSpaces("Hi, my name is John")` would return `4`.

Some hints for your work:
- Using the length of the `String` in your `boolean` condition.
- Use your loop control variable with the `substring` method to look at an individual letter and check if it is a space.
- Have an extra variable to keep track of whenever you find a space.

Make sure you are returning a final answer!

Note that there are pre-loaded tests in the main method. When done correctly, the file should run and print the expected answers.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
